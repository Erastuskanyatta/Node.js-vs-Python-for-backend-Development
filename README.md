Node.js-vs-Python for backend Development
Introduction

The comparison between Node.js and Python proves to be a great battle. However, the decision of choosing either of the two technologies for your backend development depends on your project requirements. In this article, we are going to look at the differences between Node.js and Python. By comparing the two technologies in backend development, you will notice that different technologies differ in terms of benefit and areas of application.

The backend side of every web app is the root of every project and the frontend side depends on it. No matter how beautiful and attractive your frontend is, it will always depends on the backend for it to stand. So, every developer must make a wise decision when choosing the technology to use for the backend project

For the frontend, JavaScript has no competitor. This is because of its universality character and the fact that it is easy to use. But for the backend, it has remained an argument between developers on which is the best technology to use between Node.js and Python. This is because the two technologies are the most used and are known to be the best as far as backend technologies are concerned.

The question now is, how do you choose between Node.js and Python? thinking. What are the features to look at?thinking

To answer this question, we will look at the differences between the two languages and help the developer in making decisions on which technology to use depending on the specifications.

Before we look at the comparison of the two technology, let's first look at the primary differences between the two.

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform technology and Javascript runtime environment capable of executing javascript at the server-side. It depends on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. This engine was designed by Google to compile JavaScript functions into machine code.

On the other hand, Python is a general-purpose programming language used in web development to create dynamic websites using frameworks like Flask, Django, and Pyramid. For the most part, Python runs on Google's Apps Engine.

To make an informed decision on which technology to use, we will consider the following criteria:

    Speed
    Scalability
    Universality
    Extensibility
    Architecture
