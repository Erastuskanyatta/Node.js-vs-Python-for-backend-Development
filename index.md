### Node.js-vs-Python-Which-is-the-best-Technology-for-backend-Development

### Introduction
In this article, we are going to look at the differeces between Node.js and Python and at the end were are going to prove that one technology is better than the other.

Node.js and Python are the most used languages for backend development. Developers argue that the decision of choosing either of the laguage depends on their preferences, hence there is no technology that is better than the other.

Yet, in this article we are going to prove that one technology is better than the other one by considering the foolowing criteria:

1 Speed

2 syntax

3 Extensibility

4 Universality

5 Learning curve

### Prerequisites
To follow along with this article you need to have some knowledge in [javascript]() and Python

### Primary difference between Node.js and Python
Node.js is a server side scripting language that is used to run at the server-side. It is an open source, cross-platform, javascript runtime environment that is capable to execute javascript at the server side, based on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. This engine was designed by Google to be useed in GoogleChrome. It compiles JavaScript functions into a machine code. 

On the other hand, Python is a general-purpose programming language. It is used in Web Development to create dynamic websites using frameworks like Flask, Django, and Pyramid. Just like Node.js. For the most parts Python runs on Google's Apps Engine. Likewise created by Google, the App Engine allows you to create web applications with Python and permits you to  benefit from various libraries and instruments that the best Python designers use.

NodeJS versus Python: 0 – 0

### SPEED
### Node.js
Since Node.js uses V8 Engine to intreplate JavaScript code, Its speed of performance is remarkable. V8 is a quick and incredible Engine.

Secondly, Node. JS includes a non-blocking event-driven architecture that permits various request to be made simultaneously, which speeds up the code application.

In Node.js single module caching is allowed which reduces application stacking time and makes it more responsive.

### Python
Unlike Java which is a compiled language, Python and JavaScript are interplated languages and they are generally slower than the compliled languages. 

Unlike Node.Js which makes an app more resorces and increase its performance, Python is single-flow, and requests are processed much more slowly. This makes Python not suitable for apps that requires high speed to run. Python web application are therefore slower.

Since Node.Js is faster than Python in terms of speed, it wins a point here.

### Syntax
### Node.js
Syntax betwen any language depends on the developer's decision, for that reason, I will not involve myself in comparison between Node.js and Python syntax.

For those who are familia with JavaScript, they will agree that Node.js syntax is almost similar to that of JavaScript. Therefore, if your familia with JavaScript your not going to have lots of problem learning Node.js

### Python
Python syntax has more advantage compared to Node.js. In python, developers only need to  write few lines of code  unlike in Node.js. Python syntax is easy to understand and write. It is has no curly brackets.

This makes python code easy to read and debug, in fact a begginer will have less challeges reading Python than in Node,js. But again it depends with developers experience

But in the end, because Python's syntax is easier to understand and learn for beginners, it will be fair to grant Python a point here.

NodeJS vs Python: 1 – 1

### Learning Curve
### Node.js
Node.js is JavaScript-based and can be effortlessly learned by a begginer. If you have some knowledge on JavaScript, dominating Node.js ought not be an issue.

Installing Node,js is quite simple, but it introduces some advanced topic in the process which might not be well understood by the beginner.

For instance, it might be hard to understand its event-driven architecture at first. Yet these these architecture are very useful on app performance, but developers often need some time to master it.
