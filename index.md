### Node.Js vs Python Which is the best Technology for backend Development?

### Introduction
The comparison between Node.js and Python is a great battle. However, the decision of choosing either of the two technologies for your backend development depends on your project requirements. In this article, we are going to look at the differences between Node.js and Python. By comparing the two technologies in Backend development, you will notice that different technologies differ in terms of benefit and areas of application.

The backend side of every web app is the root of every project and the frontend side depends on it. No matter how beautiful and attractive your frontend is, it will always depends on the backend for it to stand. So, every developer must make a wise decision when choosing the technology to use for the backend project

For the frontend, JavaScript has no competitor. This is because of its universality character and the fact that it is easy to use. But for the backend, it has remained an argument between developers on which is the best technology to use between Node.js and Python. This is because the two technologies are the most used and are known to be the best as far as backend technologies are concerned.

The question now is, how do you choose between Node.js and Python? ðŸ¤”. What are the features to look at?ðŸ¤”

To answer this question, we will look at the differences between the two languages and help the developer in making decisions on which technology to use depending on the specifications.

Before we look at the comparison of the two technology, let's first look at the primary differences between the two.

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform technology and Javascript runtime environment capable of executing javascript at the server-side. It depends on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. This engine was designed by Google to compile JavaScript functions into machine code.

On the other hand, Python is a general-purpose programming language used in web development to create dynamic websites using frameworks like Flask, Django, and Pyramid. For the most part, Python runs on Google's Apps Engine. Likewise created by Google, the App Engine allows you to create web applications with Python and permits you to benefit from various libraries that the best Python developers use.

To make a good decision on which technology to use, we will  consider the following criteria:
1. Speed
2. Scalability
3. Universality
4. Extensibility
5. Architecture

### SPEED
Performance and Speed are the main features that every developer wishes his project to have at the end. Every developer aims to deliver a high-performance application to the user.

#### Node.Js
Since Node.js uses [V8 Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)) to interpret JavaScript code, its performance is remarkable. V8 is a powerful JavaScript engine that is provided by Google. It converts JavaScript code into machine code that will be understood by the processor.

Node.js is also very responsive and has a very high loading speed.

#### Python
Unlike Java which is a compiled language, Python is an interpreted language. It is generally slower than the compiled languages. This makes Python lose to Node.js in terms of performance.

Python is not suitable for apps that require high execution speed. This is because of the single flow of code in Python which leads to slow processing of requests. Python web applications are therefore slower.

### SCALABILITY
Scalability is the ability of a web app to adapt to changes like an increase in performance, new features, etc.

#### Node.Js
Unlike Python, Node.js uses different modules for its functionality. Therefore, for the increase of scalability of an app developed by Node.js few modules are added. This will increase the demand of using Node.js by developers.

Node.js is an asynchronous technology. (can run multiple processes)Hence it facilitates multithreading.
#### Python
Python does not support multithreading. Therefore, scalability is not easy. For Python to have easy scalability, libraries have to be used. However, this does not mean that it can compete with Node.js in terms of scalability.

### UNIVERSALITY

 #### Node.Js
Node.js is used in backend development. For frontend development, developers prefer JavaScript. This saves on resources since only one team with Node.js skills is hired. This feature of Node.js has, in turn, led many developers to choose it.

Node.js is cross-stage. This means that a developer can create one desktop app that will work On different operating systems like MAC OS, Linux, and Windows.  This will be a great advantage to the developer in terms of the project cost.

#### Python
Python is a full-stack language. It is used in backend development while its frameworks are used in frontend development. 

A python program can be written in MAC OS and the same program run in Linux, therefore Python is also a cross-stage

Python is a good language for web development as well as desktop development, but unlike Node.js it is never used in mobile app development. 

### Extensibility
 Extensibility is the ability to add more features and functionalities to a technology. The more frameworks you add to a backend language, the more it increases its functionality.
### Node.Js
The use of Node.js and JavaScript together has led to an increase in its popularity. More frameworks have been created with Node.js being the backbone. These Frameworks include:
1. [Loopback.js](https://loopback.io/doc/)- to make dynamic end-end REST APIs with no coding.
2. [DerbyJS](https://derbyjs.com/) - to make web applications
3. [Hapi.js](https://simpleprogrammer.com/introduction-hapijs/)- for creating web services such as REST APIs

### Python
After the introduction of Python, a lot of frameworks and development tools have been created.

For instance, Python can be incorporated with code editors like Sublime Text, which offers some additional editing features and punctuation extensions.

The great extensibility of Python and the use of many frameworks have made Python be such a great backend language that every developer would desire to use. Python frameworks include:

1. [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/)

2. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)

3. [Web2Py](https://loopback.io/doc/)

### Architecture
Another important feature that a developer should give a priority before choosing the backend language is the architecture. They are two types of architecture:

- Synchronous -  Job is first completed before accepting another request.
- Asynchronous - Here, more than one process can run at the same time.

### Node.Js
Node.js enables asynchronous. A process can be called even if another event is occurring. This means that no process is ever blocked. The different processes can be processed .

Node.js is event-driven(can respond to the user in various ways). Therefore it is suitable for the development of games.

### Python
Python is not event-driven. To build an event-driven app using Python, you needs to install some tool like [CPython](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17130975/python-vs-cpython).

Python enables synchronous. This makes it slow and therefore it is not suitable for projects that require a high speed of execution. So if you want to create a game program you'd rather not choose Python but Node.js

### Wrap up
From the above comparison,  it is evident that a software may work on one project but may not work on another different project. 
Thus, when choosing between Node.js and  Python, it is important to consider the needs and requirements of the two languages.

I now believe that it will be easy to choose either of the two languages when working on the backend side. Keep these results with you when choosing between Node.js and Python.
 This doesn't imply that Python and Node.js are the most ideal
