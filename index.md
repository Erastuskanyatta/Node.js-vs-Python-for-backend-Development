### Node js vs Python Which is the best Technology for backend Development

### Introduction
In this article, we are going to look at the difference between Node.js and Python. By comparing the two languages in Backened developmet, you will notice that different technologies differ in terms of benefit and application areas.

Node.js and Python are the most used languages for backend development. Developers argue that the decision of choosing either of the languages depends on their preferences, hence there is no technology that is better than the other.

Yet, in this article we are going to prove that one technology is better than the other one by considering the following criteria:

1 Speed

2 syntax

3 Extensibility

4 Universality

5 Learning curve

### Prerequisites
To follow along with this article you need to have some knowledge in [javascript]() and Python

### Primary difference between Node.js and Python
Node.js is a server-side scripting language that is used to run at the server-side. It is an open-source, cross-platform, javascript runtime environment that is capable to execute javascript at the server-side, based on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. This engine was designed by Google to be used in GoogleChrome. It compiles JavaScript functions into machine code. 

On the other hand, Python is a general-purpose programming language. It is used in Web Development to create dynamic websites using frameworks like Flask, Django, and Pyramid. Just like Node.js. For the most part, Python runs on Google's Apps Engine. Likewise created by Google, the App Engine allows you to create web applications with Python and permits you to benefit from various libraries and instruments that the best Python designers use.

NodeJS versus Python: 0 – 0

### SPEED
### Node.js
Since Node.js uses V8 Engine to interplate JavaScript code, Its speed of performance is remarkable. V8 is a quick and incredible Engine.

Secondly, Node. JS includes a non-blocking event-driven architecture that permits various requests to be made simultaneously, which speeds up the code application.

In Node.js single module caching is allowed which reduces application stacking time and makes it more responsive.

### Python
Unlike Java which is a compiled language, Python and JavaScript are interpreted languages and they are generally slower than the compiled languages. 

Unlike Node.Js which makes an app more resources and increases its performance, Python is single-flow, and requests are processed much more slowly. This makes Python not suitable for apps that require high speed to run. Python web applications are therefore slower.

Since Node.Js is faster than Python in terms of speed, it wins a point here.

### Syntax
### Node.js
Syntax between any language depends on the developer's decision, for that reason, I will not involve myself in comparison between Node.js and Python syntax.

Those who are familiar with JavaScript will agree that Node.js syntax is almost similar to that of JavaScript. Therefore, if your familiar with JavaScript your not going to have lots of problem learning Node.js

### Python
Python syntax has more advantages compared to Node.js. In python, developers only need to write few lines of code unlike in Node.js. Python syntax is easy to understand and write. It has no curly brackets.

This makes python code easy to read and debug and a beginner will have fewer challenges reading Python than in Node.Js. But again it depends on developers experience

But in the end, because Python's syntax is easier to understand and learn for beginners, it will be fair to grant Python a point here.

### Learning Curve
### Node.js
Node.js is JavaScript-based and can be effortlessly learned by a beginner. If you have some knowledge of JavaScript, dominating Node.js ought not to be an issue.

Installing Node.Js is quite simple, but it introduces some advanced topic in the process which might not be well understood by the beginner.

For instance, it might be hard to understand its event-driven architecture at first. Yet these architecture are very useful for app performance, but developers often need some time to master it.


### Python
Python Syntax is simple and compact, this makes Python easier to read and understand compared to Node.js

Generally, a code of function in Python has few lines of code compared to the same code of Node.js. But again the number of lines in a code depends on the level of skills of a developer.

When learning Python, you end up learning how to indent your code in the right way because the language is indentation sensitive. However, a single indentation mistake can break your entire code. This may end up discarding the beginner since with wrong indentation the code will not run.

In Linux like Ubuntu, Python is already installed by default, so the developer will not have to spend his time in Installation. Similarly in Widows, installing  Python is very easy. In MAC OS  Python 2.0 is already installed, but this version is never used as it will interfere with system libraries. Instead, another version is downloaded. After downloading, selecting the proper version in the development environment is very important.

In conclusion, both languages are easy to learn depending on the developer's skill, therefore each technology will receive a point here.

NodeJS vs Python: 2 – 2


### Universality
### Node.js
Node.Js is mainly used in backend development. For front-end development, developers use JavaScript. This is a great advantage because the developer ends up using the same language for both backend and frontend.

With Node.js, you can create web applications as well desktop and hybrid mobile apps, alongside cloud and IoT solutions.

Node.Js is cross-stage. This means that a developer can create one desktop app that will work On different operating systems like MAC OS, Linux, and Windows.  This will be a great advantage to the developer in terms of the project cost.

### Python 
Unlike Node.Js, Python is a full-stack, which means it can be used in both frontend and backend development. 

A python program can be written in MAC OS and the same program run in Linux, therefore Python is also a cross-stage

Python is a good language for web development as well as desktop development, but unlike Node.Js it is never used in mobile app development.

Here, I will be fair enough to grand Node.Js a point since it is used in mobile development, unlike Python.

NodeJS vs Python: 3 – 2

### Extensibility
### Node.Js
Node.Js has several frameworks that are used to extend it. These frameworks include:

  1)[Loopback.js](https://loopback.io/doc/)- to make dynamic end-end REST APIs with practically no coding.

  2)[DerbyJS](https://derbyjs.com/) - to make web applications

  3)[Hapi.js](https://simpleprogrammer.com/introduction-hapijs/#:~:text=Js-,hapi.,HTTP%20proxy%20applications%20with%20hapi.&text=I%20started%20using%20Express%20to%20build%20my%20web%20apps.)- for creating JSON APIs
### Python 
After the Introduction of Python, a lot of frameworks and development tools have been created.

For instance, Python can be incorporated with code editors like Sublime Text, which offers some additional editing features and punctuation extensions.

Frameworks that are used to extend Python Include:

1)[Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/)

2)[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)

3)[Web2Py](https://loopback.io/doc/)

Both extensions are easily extensible therefore both get a point here.

NodeJS vs Python: 4 – 3


### Conclusion
From the above comparison, Node.Js have won by 1 point. These results are from my view, different programmers may differentiate the two technology in other ways. Therefore, choosing either of the languages will depend on the developer's skill and experience.

Both technologies are good in terms of learming curve and extensiblity. Node.Js has a good speed of performance compared to Python. But in terms of Syntax, it looses to Python since Python Syntax is more friendly to a begginer.

The above Points does not mean that Node,Js is perfect than Python, the decision of choosing them depends on the project to be done.
