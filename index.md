### Node js vs Python Which is the best Technology for backend Development 
### Introduction
The go-ahead between Node.Js and Python is a great battle. However, the decision of choosing either of the two languages for your backend development depends on your requirements. In this article, we are going to look at the differences between Node.js and Python. By comparing the two languages in Backend development, you will notice that different technologies differ in terms of benefit and areas of application.

The backend side of every website, an app, or any other(), is the root of every project and the frontend side depends on it. No matter how beautiful and attractive your frontend side is, it will always depends on the backend for it to stand. Therefore, every developer must make a wise decision when choosing the language to use for the backend project

For the frontend side, JavaScript has attracted every developer to use it. This is because of its universality character and the fact that it is easy to use. But for the backend side, it has remained an argument between developers on which is the best technology to use between Node.Js and Python. This is because the two languages are the most used and are known to be the best as far as backend languages are concerned.

The question now is, how do you choose between Node.Js and Python? {emoji}. What are the features to look at?

To answer this question, I will look at the differences between the two languages and help the developer in making decisions on which language to use depending on the specification.

Before we look at the comparison of the two technology, let's first look at the primary differences between the two.

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform technology and javascript runtime environment capable of executing javascript at the server-side. It is based on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. This engine was designed by Google to be used in Google's Chrome web browser. V8 compiles JavaScript functions into machine code.

On the other hand, Python is a general-purpose programming language used in Web Development to create dynamic websites using frameworks like Flask, Django, and Pyramid.  For the most part, Python runs on Google's Apps Engine. Likewise created by Google, the App Engine allows you to create web applications with Python and permits you to benefit from various libraries that the best Python developers use.

To make a good decision on which technology to use, we will  consider the following criteria:
1. Speed
2. Scalability
3. Extensibility
4. Universality
5. Learning curve

### SPEED
Performance and Speed are the main features that every developer wishes his project to have at the end. Not even the user would want the website or an app to have low speed and performance.

Unlike Java which is a compiled language, Python and JavaScript are interpreted languages and they are generally slower than the compiled languages.

#### Node.Js
Since Node.js uses V8 Engine to interpret JavaScript code, its performance is remarkable. V8 is a Google fund engine. It converts Js code into a  machine code that will be understood by the processor.

Node.Js is also very responsive and has a very high speed of loading

#### Python 
Unlike Node.js (which increases the performance of an app), Python codes are moved step by step. This leads to lower performance and ends up consuming a lot of time.

Therefore, Python is not suitable for apps that require high execution speed. Python web applications are therefore slower.

### SCALABILITY
Scalability is the ability of a language to adapt to changes like increase in performance, new features, and changes in maintainance.

#### Node.Js


#### Python
